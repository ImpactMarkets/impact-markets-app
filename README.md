## Setup

## Local dependencies

- Node.js

  Node versions > 16 can currently cause this [segmentation fault](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/10649).

  The Node version required is specified in `package.json` and `.nvmrc`.

  To use the correct version, install `nvm`, then run those commands:

  ```sh
  nvm install
  nvm use
  ```

- docker-compose

  Linux Mint: `sudo apt install docker-compose`

### Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Prepare the database

- Set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ask @Telofy for the Google client credentials. Put them in the `.env` in those two lines:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

- Start the database

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Create the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Launch the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### FAQ and Common Problems

- I pulled main and now I'm getting a lot of type errors on files I didn't touch when I try to commit. How do I fix this?

Try running `npx prisma generate`. These may be from schema changes someone else made that haven't propagated on your local instance yet. Sometimes you also need to restart the dev server after regenerating the client.

### Styles

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [Mantine] (https://mantine.dev/) to handle styles. If at all possible, please use Tailwind for styling components, even Mantine components, so we donâ€™t incur so much complexity from mixing the two systems.

To make changes to default Tailwind CSS values, modify the `tailwind.config.js` file located at the root of the project.
